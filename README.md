## Hi there 👋 I'm Dhanshika Vijayaraj!

I'm a Seattle native with roots in Tamil Nadu. I'm fluent in Tamil, and I proudly embrace both my cultural heritage and the vibrant energy of the Pacific Northwest.

I am a rising Junior at the University of Washington majoring in Data Visualization and minoring in Informatics, Applied Computing, and Computer Science. 

One thing you have to know me is… I LOVE dance*! 💃🏿 I have been dancing classical Bharatanatyam for over 15 years and envision starting my own dance school one day and sharing my passion. I recently performed my graduation recital, which I spent 2 years training for! 

My passion for technology ignited in my sophomore year of high school, and ever since, I've been on a mission to make a meaningful impact in the tech world. I get excited about discovering and diving into new technologies, but what really drives me is data! Data is everywhere—seriously, everywhere—and its potential to spark innovation and create change is what fuels my enthusiasm. Whether it's uncovering insights from complex datasets or finding creative ways to leverage data for social good, I’m all about turning numbers into actionable stories that can shape the future. I'm eager to harness the power of data to make a real difference and leave a lasting, positive mark on the industry!

*I also LOVE movies(theatres in specific🍿) , ice cream 🍦, cooking yummy food 👩🏿‍🍳, sky pics 🌅, and love exploring 🗺️
